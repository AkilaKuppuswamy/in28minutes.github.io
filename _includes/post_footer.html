	<ul>
		<li>★★★★★ Excellent, fabulous. The way he has prepared the material and the way he teaches is <b>really awesome</b>. What an effort .. Thanks a million</li>
		<li>★★★★★ I was having misconception that  the topic Docker is tough one to understand. And <b>you made it really easy</b>. Thank you so much and I would really recommend my colleagues/friends to learn it from your tutorial.</li>
		<li>★★★★★ <b>Great course on K8s and Spring Boot</b>.  I have several in28Minutes course bought on Udemy.  They are always of very high quality.  I have learned so much and **put my trust in every course from in28Minutes**.</li>
		<li>★★★★★ The teaching on this course is **heads above the others**.  I switched from one of the other Spring course to this one and I'm very glad I did.  Each concept is explained very clearly so that <b>you understand WHY Spring came about and what it's doing</b> rather than just blindly following a demo of 'put this here, put that there' like on some other courses.</li>
		<li>★★★★★ The <b>course is great</b>! I like that everything is explained based on real-life examples! </li>
