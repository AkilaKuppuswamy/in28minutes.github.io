		<br/>★★★★★ This guy is fantastic. Really. Wonderful teaching skills, and goes well out of his way to make sure that everything he is doing is fully understood.
		<br/>★★★★★ He explains the concepts really well and also makes sure that there is not a single line of code you type without understanding what it really does. 
		<br/>★★★★★ Amazing course. Explained super difficult concepts (that I have spent hours on the internet finding a good explanation) in under 5 minutes.
