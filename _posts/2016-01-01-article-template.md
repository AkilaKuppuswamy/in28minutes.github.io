## Resources/URLs/Entities Overview

In this guide, we will create three services using proper URIs and HTTP methods:

## Project Code Structure

Following screenshot shows the structure of the project we will create.
![Image](/images/TODO.png "TODO-DESC") 

A few details:
- SpringBootTutorialBasicsApplication.java - The Spring Boot Application class generated with Spring Initializer. This class acts as the launching point for application.
- `pom.xml` - Contains all the dependencies needed to build this project. We will use Spring Boot Starter AOP.


## Tools you will need
- Maven 3.0+ is your build tool
- Your favorite IDE. We use Eclipse.
- JDK 1.8+

## Complete Maven Project With Code Examples

Some theory

## Bootstrapping with Spring Initializr

Creating a REST service with Spring Initializr is a cake walk. We will use Spring Web MVC as our web framework.  

Spring Initializr [http://start.spring.io/](http://start.spring.io/){:target="_blank"} is great tool to bootstrap your Spring Boot projects.

As shown in the image above, following steps have to be done

- Launch Spring Initializr and choose the following
  - Choose `TODO` as Group
  - Choose `TODO` as Artifact
  - Choose following dependencies
    - Web
    - DevTools
    - TODO
- Click Generate Project.
- Import the project into Eclipse. File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project.
- If you want to understand all the files that are part of this project, you can go here TODO.

## STEP 1 : TODO


## Step N : Executing the TODO Service 

Below picture shows how we can execute this Get Service from Postman - my favorite tool to run rest services.

## Executing a POST Rest Service

Example Request is shown below. 

```json
```

Below picture shows how we can execute this Post Service from Postman - my favorite tool to run rest services. Make sure you go to the Body tab and select raw. Select JSON from the dropdown. Copy above request into body.
